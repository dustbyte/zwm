Coding Style:
-A block is always defined between braces;
-Use strl(cpy|cat);
-Use std::string instead of string.h;
-Overall, use as much C++ as you can;
-Use as much significant code as you can, don't fear to be verbose;
-Comment as much as possible, plz;
-when using pointer or references, append the ampersand or the asterisk to
 the type: use std::string* name instead of std::string *name;
-A destructor is ALWAYS virtual;
-explicitely specify the global namespace for c functions
 (eg: ::read(1, buf, 512));
-When a method is defined but not implemented, add a comment to mean it
 (eg: //not implemented)

From *Wesnoth.org*:
-Avoid implicit conversions;
-Do not use non-private data members of classes;
-/!\ Use References when a value may not be NULL;
-/!\ Use Const;
-/!\ Write Exception-Safe Code;
-Use snprintf instead of sprintf;
-Use std::stringstream <sstream>
-/!\ Do not use 0 when you mean NULL;
